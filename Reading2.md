### 4.1 Introduction
#### 4.1.1 Forwarding and Routing
* Role of network layer is simple: move packets from sending host to receiving host. We do this via two steps:
  1. Forwarding: When a packet arrives at a router's input link, the router must move it to the appropriate output link.
  2. Routing: The network layer must determine the route packets take as they flow from sender to receiver. This necessitates the use of routing algorithms.
