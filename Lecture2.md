## Packet Switching: Statistical Multiplexing
* Sequence of A & B packets does not have fixed pattern, badwidth is shared on demand
* TDM (Time-Division Multiplexing): Each host gets same slot in revolving TDM frame
* Packet switching vs. circuit switching
  * Packet switching allows more users to use network
    * 1 MB/s link
    * Each user
      * 100kb/s when active
      * Active 10% of the time
  * Circuit switching
    * 10 users
  * Packet switching
    * With 35 users, probability > 10 active at the same time is less than 0.0004
