# *Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach* - Kurose (2016)
## Chapter 1: Computer Networks and the Internet
### 1.1 What is the Internet?
#### 1.1.1 A Nuts-and-Bolts Description
* Devices connected to internet are called *hosts* or *end systems*
* End systems are connected by a network of *communication links* and *packet switches*
* Different links can transmit data at different rates
  * Transmission rate of a link measured in bits/second
* Sending end-system segments data and adds header bytes to each segment; these segments are called *packets*
* Two most prominent types of packet switches are *routers* and *link-layer switches*
  * Forward packets to their ultimate destinations
* End systems access the internet through internet service providers (ISPs)
* End systems, packet switches, and other pieces of the Internet run *protocols* that control the sending and receiving of info
  * Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) are mot important
* Internet standards are developed by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
  * Standards documents are called requests for comments (RFCs)
#### 1.1.2 A Services Description
* Distributed applications involve multiple end systems that exchange data
* Internet apps run on end systems, not in packet switches
* End systems attached to the internet provide an API that specifies how a program running on one end system asks the Internet infrastructure to deliver data to a specific destination program running on another end system
#### 1.1.3 What is a Protocol?
* A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event
### 1.2 The Network Edge
* Hosts are divided into two categories: clients and servers
  * Most servers are stored in large data centers
#### 1.2.1 Access Networks
* Two most prevalent types of broadband residential access are digital subscriber line (DSL) and cable
  * DSL provided by telco
  * Cable provided by television company
### 1.3 The Network Core
#### 1.3.1 Packet Switching
* End systems exchange messages with eachother
  * To accomplish this, the source breaks messages into packets
  * Packets travel through links and packet switches
    * Two types of packet switches: routers and link-layer switches
* Most packet switches use *store-and-forward* transmission at the inputs to links
  * Packet switch must receive entire packet before it can begin the transfer the packet onto the outbound link
  * Routers must buffer packet's bits until all are received
  * end-to-end delay (d<sub>end-to-end</sub>) = NL/R
    * N is the number of links in the system
    * R is the transmission rate of each link
    * L is the number of bits transmitted
##### Queuing Delays and Packet Loss
* Each packet switch has multiple links attached; for each attached link, the packet switch has an *output buffer* (AKA output queue) which stores packets that the router is about to send into that link
* If an arriving packet needs to be transmitted but the link is busy with the transmission of another packet, the arriving packet needs to wait in the output buffer
  * This is called *queuing delay*
* Since buffer space is finite, it is possible that an arriving packet finds the buffer full with other packages
  * *Packet loss* occurs in this situation; either the ariving packet or one of the already-queued packets will be dropped
##### Forwarding Tables and Routing Protocols
* Each router has a forwarding table that maps destination addresses to that router's outbound links
#### 1.3.2 Circuit Switching
* There are two approaches to moving data trhough a network: *circuit switching* and *packet switching*
* In circuit-switched networks, the resources needed along a path (buffers, link transmission rate) are reserved for the duration of communcation between the end systems
  * Ex. telephone networks. You establish a *circuit* With the receiver of your call; resources are reserved for the two of you
##### Multiplexing in Circuit-Switched Networks
* A circuit in a link is implemented with either *frequency-division multiplexing (FDM)* or *time-division multiplexing (TDM)*
  * In FDM: the frequency spectrum of a link is divided amongst the connections established across the link
    * A frequency band is dedicated to each connection for the duration of the connection
    * The width of this band is called the bandwidth
  * In TDM: time is divided into frames of fixed duration, each frame is divided into a fixed number of time slots
##### Packet Switching Versus Circuit Switching
* Packet switching not suitable for real-time services (ie. telephone and video conference calls) 
* Packet switching offers better sharing of transmission capacity and is simpler + more efficient to implement
#### 1.3.3 A Network of Networks
* PoP (point of presence): group of one or more routers at the same location in the provider's network where customer ISPs can connect into the provider ISP
### 1.4 Delay, Loss. and Throughput in Packet-Switched Networks
#### 1.4.1 Overview of Delay in Packet-Switched Networks
* Types of delay: nodal processing delay, queuing delay, transmission delay; together, these give a total nodal delay
* d<sub>nodal</sub> = d<sub>proc</sub> + d<sub>queue</sub> + d<sub>trans</sub> + d<sub>prop</sub>
##### Processing Delay
* Time required to examine the packet's header and determine where to direct the packet
##### Queuing Delay
* Time waited in queue before packet transmitted onto link
##### Transmission Delay
* d<sub>trans</sub> = L/R, where L is the number of bits and R is the transmission rate of the link
##### Propagation Delay
* After a bit is pushed into the link, the time required to propagate from the beginning of the link to router B
  * Distance between two routers divided by the propagation speed: d<sub>prop</sub> = d/s, where d is the distance between router A and router B and s is the propagation speed of the link
