## Chapter 1: Computer Networks and the Internet
### 1.1 What is the Internet?
#### 1.1.1 A Nuts-and-Bolts Description
* Devices connected to internet are called *hosts* or *end systems*
* End systems are connected by a network of *communication links* and *packet switches*
* Different links can transmit data at different rates
  * Transmission rate of a link measured in bits/second
* Sending end-system segments data and adds header bytes to each segment; these segments are called *packets*
* Two most prominent types of packet switches are *routers* and *link-layer switches*
  * Forward packets to their ultimate destinations
* End systems access the internet through internet service providers (ISPs)
* End systems, packet switches, and other pieces of the Internet run *protocols* that control the sending and receiving of info
  * Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) are mot important
* Internet standards are developed by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
  * Standards documents are called requests for comments (RFCs)
#### 1.1.2 A Services Description
* Distributed applications involve multiple end systems that exchange data
* Internet apps run on end systems, not in packet switches
* End systems attached to the internet provide an API that specifies how a program running on one end system asks the Internet infrastructure to deliver data to a specific destination program running on another end system
#### 1.1.3 What is a Protocol?
* A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event
### 1.2 The Network Edge
* Hosts are divided into two categories: clients and servers
  * Most servers are stored in large data centers
#### 1.2.1 Access Networks
* Two most prevalent types of broadband residential access are digital subscriber line (DSL) and cable
  * DSL provided by telco
  * Cable provided by television company
